::FaqItem{title="The mod isn't working, what should I do?"}
  There are several scenarios where the mod might not work:

  <br>

  - If no notification from the mod appears upon entering the game:
    - Check and **double-check** that the mod is installed in the correct folder with the current game version.
    - Confirm again that you're using the mod for the **current** game version, as specified in the instructions above.

  <br>

  - If the notification appears upon entering the game, but positions aren't displayed:
    - Ensure your license hasn't expired (license expiration is shown in the notification).
    - If you use a mod configurator, check that the "Positions by WotStat" mod isn't disabled, and markers aren't hidden.
    - Reactivate the license by clicking the `reset` button in the notification and repeat the activation process.
    - Wait a few hours, as there may be server issues.

  Sharing your license key with third parties is prohibited.

::FaqItem{title="Does the mod work with light tanks?"}
  Partially.

  The mod displays positions specifically for **firing**.
  On some maps, firing positions coincide with spotting positions, but this isn't always the case.

  <br>

  Damage-dealing isn't the primary task for light tanks, so prioritize situational awareness and spotting opportunities first, then firing positions.
::

---

::FaqItem{title="Does the mod support flamethrower tanks?"}
  No.

  Because flamethrower tanks don't have shots in the conventional sense, WotStat currently lacks data on their firing, thus the mod can't calculate positions for them.

  <br>

  Support for flamethrower tanks may be added in future WotStat updates.
